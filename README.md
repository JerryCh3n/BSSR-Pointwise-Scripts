# BSSR-Pointwise-Scripts

Instructions on how to run each script is documented in the script itself. To run the script in Pointwise, navigate to the _Script_ menu at the top of the tool bar.


### Airfoil Mesher.glf

This script generates a C-grid mesh around any airfoil automatically. The airfoil must first be exported as a set of points from JavaFoil.

### Left Body Farfielder.glf and Full Body Farfielder.glf

These scripts generate the farfield for aerobody meshes automatically. "Left Body" is used for half-left body aerobody meshes, while "Full Body" is used for full aerobody simulations.
